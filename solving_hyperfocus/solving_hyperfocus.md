# SOLVING HYPERFOCUS

Actually there are many different causes and medical reasons for hyperfocus and anything related to it like ADHD and ASD, but for me there are 4 main problems that definitely affect my life in a bad way:

1. Uncompleted projects
2. Endless searching for my passion
3. Waiting for the one idealized idea that brings meaning to the world
4. So many topics I want to dive in

This lifecircle perfectly describes this issue.

### Solution

> Transform your biggest weakness to your biggest advantage.

But how to apply this concept to hyperfocus? When we're looking on my hyperfocus lifecycle there is maybe a simple solution. We should not change any of these in detail but remove some. Removing is definitely easier than changing! It starts with the passion thing, thinking that it is necessary and always right to find a passion to focus on, become expert, do meaningful work, [10.000 hour rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book)), ...
It continues with the mammut project, that of course has the potential to change the world and ~~anyone is already waiting for it.~~

And that's it. For me it was life changing to just stick with becoming curious, deep dive in and repeat.

Using your hyperfocus to expand your knowledge in a wide range. And what do you think about:

> Jack of all trades, master of none

Maybe that fits to me now. But to be honest, I really needed a solution. And even if it's not perfect, it's good for me. This is our weakness and we should use it for our advantage. It's a fact that this will make you at least better than the average, wasting their time with Instagram and Netflix. Beeing better than the average is definitely a form of success.

*P.S. Maybe you noticed it already, but stand by me that this repository is not a mammut project. ðŸ˜‰*
